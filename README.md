- Creativity Games Idea Generator: [Random Word Generator](https://ideagenerator.creativitygames.net/)


## Purpose
This project was created as a way to facilitate being able to participate in the forum for the humor threads when taking CS 7637 KBAI in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program.

## How is a comic created?
1. Generate a random word from the [Creativity Games Idea Generator](https://ideagenerator.creativitygames.net/).

2. Open [AI Comic Maker by Elio Testa](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1LM0T9LSW-ai-comic-maker) in ChatGPT.
3. Direct the AI Comic Maker to create a comic about the random word.
    - Example: Let's create a comic about a mistake
4. The AI will ask you for more information, specifically for more details about the story to generate, which it will give you sample questions to answer and ask you what size comic image you want: square (1:1), landscape (16:9), or portrait (9:16).
5. The AI will generate a comic as text only first and ask you if you like the idea or if you want to change it.
6. When you like the comic idea, it will create the comic image.
