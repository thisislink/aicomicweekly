# Bubble Trouble

## Comic Text

### Panel 1 (Left): 

A character is chewing bubble gum and blows a bubble. The bubble bursts and covers the character in bubble gum.

### Panel 2 (Right): 

A passerby sees the character covered in bubble gum and says "Looks like you're in a sticky situation!".

## Struggles with Generating the Comic

Although I would have considered this a simplier comic, beccause it only had two panels, AI struggled with this comic in several areas. It struggled with generating the text, and when it would generate the text, it often became confused and would create more than two panels, even when prompted to only create two panels.
